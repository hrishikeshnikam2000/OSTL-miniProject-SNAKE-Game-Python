# OSTLminiProject-python
This was my submission for the the OPEN SOURCE TECH LAB (ostl) Sem-3 (MU)

There are 3 projects in this repository.

          1)Snake Game in python using pygame and tkinter.(Title :-OSTL-mini_project.py)
          2)Hotel Management Project in python(Hotelms.py)
          3)Turtle animation Game in Python(Turtle.py)

## Snake-Game in python!
This game was my mini-project for OSTL! (PYTHON)
The classic snake game. Made with pygame.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygame
If you guys don't have python3 installed then kindly download it online.
This game doesn't run on VScode even if you install the plug-ins.
Don't forget to import pygame library once python file is dowloaded.

## hotelmanagement
Another project which was created for mini project was a hotel management project
It is very basic and you could add more features to it, it works just fine without any additions and is very simple to understand.

## Turtle Game in Python
This was something i built for fun and i thorouhly enjoyed making these.
It might not be good enough to be an official presentation.
But the important thing was it helped me to get a hold on Python and more importantly learn pygame.
This is one of those things where i enjoyed making it but it might not seem impressive to the viewer! 

### personal note :)
Thankyou for having a look at this game
You can also run Snake-Game in Gitpod,which can be run online.
I have set this game according to my convienience!
If you guys don't like the speed or design you can changes it as you want it.
Constructive criticism is welcomed!


Have a nice day!
